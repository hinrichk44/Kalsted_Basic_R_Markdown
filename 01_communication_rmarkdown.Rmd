The data between the dashes below is known as the "YAML"

The default output is an html document. You could switch to a PDF if you wanted to 

toc stands for Table of Contents. Simply "yes" or "no"

toc_depth allows for indentation of headers in the table of contents

code_folding can be switched between "none" and "show". Basically it means you can show the code run or not
In general, show code to technical audiences and don't show code to non-technical audiences 

df_print has the options of "paged" and "tibble"
Any time we print a dataframe or tibble, we don't want to show the entire thing in case the dataset is large
Paged breaks the dataframe down by page where you can click on a page to see more of the dataframe/tibble
Tibble just shows the first few rows and describes the size of the tibble

highlight describes how you want the code to be highlighted. One common option is "tango"

number_sections allows you to number the parts of your R Markdown document. Simply "yes" or "no"

theme just gives you a theme for your R Markdwown document. A common option is "flatly"

## What can RMarkdown be used for?

1. [HTML Reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) & [PDF Reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)
2. [HTML Slide Decks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html) & [PowerPoint](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html)
3. [Interactive Dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html)
4. [Books with `bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/)
5. [Websites with `blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

# How RMarkdown Works

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

# Working with Text

Free-form text.

Make text __bold__.

Make text _italics_.

Make text ___bold + italics___.

Talk about code - the `tidyverse` is awesome

__Unordered List:__

- Item 1

- Item 2

__Ordered List:__

1. First point
  
  - Sub Point 1
  
  - Sub Point 2

2. Second point

3. More points



# Tabset {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Tab 1

This is Tab 1

## Tab 2

This is Tab 2


# Images

![Business Science Logo](img/business-science-logo.png){width=100px}

```{r, out.width="100px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Business Science Logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/business-science-logo.png")
```


# Code 

Read in data and print to HTML. Notice effect of `df_print: paged` option for HTML. 

- Try changing to `df_print: default`, or `kable` or `tibble`. PDF prints normally.

- Try changing `results = "hide"`.

```{r}
bike_orderlines_tbl <- read_rds(path = "00_data/bike_sales/data_wrangled/bike_orderlines.rds")

bike_orderlines_tbl
```

We can do data manipulations too. Try changing the YAML `code_folding` option from `none` to `hide` to `show`.

```{r}
revenue_by_category_tbl <- bike_orderlines_tbl %>%
  select(category_2, category_1, total_price) %>%
  
  group_by(category_2, category_1) %>%
  summarise(total_revenue = sum(total_price)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  
  arrange(desc(total_revenue)) %>%
  mutate(category_2 = as_factor(category_2) %>% fct_rev())
  
```


# Plots

Plotting works as expected. Try changin:

- `out.height`, `out.width` and Knitting

- Potential gotcha - Interactive plots (e.g. `plotly`) will not display in PDF

__Static Plots:__ 

- Use `ggplot2`.

```{r, fig.cap="Revenue by Category", out.height="600px"}
# fig.keep toggles whether or not to show figures. Code is always run. 
g <- revenue_by_category_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(category_2, total_revenue, fill = category_1)) +
  
  # Geoms
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  
  # Formatting
  scale_fill_tq() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  theme_tq() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Revenue by Category",
    x = "", y = "", fill = ""
  )

g
  
```

__Interactive plots:__ 

- Use `ggplotly()`.

```{r, out.height="500px", out.width="100%"}
ggplotly(g)
```


# Tables

__Static Tables:__

- `knitr` package - `knitr::kable()` - Simple to use, great with PDF
- [`gt` package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) - Not on CRAN yet, but really good for static tables

```{r, fig.cap="Top Bike Categories"}
table_formatted_tbl <- revenue_by_category_tbl %>%
  mutate(total_revenue = scales::dollar(total_revenue)) %>%
  rename_all(.funs = ~ str_replace(., "_", " ") %>%
               str_to_title()) 

table_formatted_tbl %>% knitr::kable()
```

__Dynamic Tables:__

- Can print tables without additional formatting in HTML with the `df_print: paged` option in YAML
- Potential Gotcha: Note that this will not print with format in PDF

```{r}
table_formatted_tbl
```
